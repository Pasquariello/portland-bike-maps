## Getting Started

There are two ways in which you can run this application. 

First you can do so using docker. In order to run the application from the project root directory run the development server:

```bash
docker compose up

```

This should start the server that will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  


Your next option is to run the project locally with npm, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
